# Student Administration System v2

A student project created with spring boot, MySql, java, thymeleaf, html and css. However this time I am using preparedstatements for the backend with the database instead of JdbcTemplate or JpaInterface.

A project created with:

- Spring Boot/Java/MySql (backend)
- HTML/CSS/Thymeleaf (frontend)
